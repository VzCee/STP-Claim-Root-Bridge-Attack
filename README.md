# STP-Claim-Root-Bridge-Attack
Academic project built with Scapy to simulate an STP Root Bridge Claim attack. It demonstrates how forged superior BPDUs can force a malicious device to become the root bridge, redirecting network traffic through the attacker and exposing interception risks, emphasizing the need for BPDU Guard and secure switch configurations.
